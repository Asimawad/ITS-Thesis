\chapter{Introduction}
% This is a textual citation \citet{shannon44}. And this is a parenthetical citation \citep{shannon44}. You probably want to use the latter more often.

\section{Moving On}
Let's demonstrate a figure by looking at Fig.~\ref{bandwidth}. 

\begin{figure}[!h]
% Use "\centering" in floats (figure, table), but if you need to center
% some text (why?) use "\begin{center}...\end{center}".
\centering 
% Figure environments same as 0.8 * \textwidth please
% That does not necessarily mean the actual picture size,
% it is a guideline for the environment which could contain
% 2 or more pictures! Be consistent and follow the guidelines
% provided in your sources.
\includegraphics[width=0.8\textwidth]{images/bandwidth-colour.png}
\caption{Planning community bandwidth sharing costs. 
  Note caption capitalization.}
\label{bandwidth} 
% if you move the label it breaks the reference numbering; 
% always have it *after* the caption.
\end{figure}

% Remember how to include code with {\tt verbatim} 
% and to fix the tabs in {\sf python} in a verbatim environment? 
% It may be best to have an `include' command for code, 
% not to have to re-edit it all the time.

% An AIMS Essay can use the sectioning commands "\chapter", "\section",

% The abstract is the first thing we want to see. No acknowledgements or

% We number roman numerals until the main body

% Figures may differ between topics, but they are not there

% Asim Osman, 12 May 2025


% A short, abstracted description of your research project goes here. 
% It should be about 100 words long. But write it last.

% An abstract is not a summary of your research project: it's an abstraction of that. 
% It tells the readers why they should be interested in your research project but summarises all
% they need to know if they read no further.

% The writing style used in an abstract is like the style used in the rest of your research project: concise, clear and direct. 
% In the rest of the research project, however, you will introduce and use technical terms. In the abstract you should
% avoid them in order to make the result comprehensible to all.

% You may like to repeat the abstract in your mother tongue.

% At a unviersity like Stellenbosch you *must* produce an abstract in Afrikaans for your masters.
% At AIMS you are encouraged to repeat the abstract in your mother tongue
% French, Igbo, Mlagasy, etc. just write it using LaTeX's special
% characters.
% Arabic students see the arabic.tex file for an example
% Amharic use openoffice and export from there and import a figure here.
% Where the words do not exist put the English work in italics, or use mathematical symbols.



% Do not change anything below this except for adding your
% signature (replace images/signature.png) and your name.
